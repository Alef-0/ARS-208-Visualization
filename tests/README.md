# Test suite map

The test suite is organized by behavior rather than mirroring every source
module. Run it from the repository root with:

```bash
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python3 -m pytest -q
```

Disabling automatic plugin loading prevents unrelated system-wide pytest
plugins from affecting this project.

## Areas covered

| Test file | Main coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `test_connection_packages.py` | ARS40X packet extraction, scaling, merge behavior, and configuration bit layout |
| `test_message_module_split.py` | Compatibility exports after cluster/object message separation |
| `test_object_message_update.py` | Extended object fields, missing optional values, and object filter behavior |
| `test_graph_filter.py` | Dynamic, quality, ambiguity, invalid-state, and RCS filtering |
| `test_point_cloud_recorder.py` | Cluster/object PCD schemas, writer behavior, and recording sessions |
| `test_recording_changes.py` | Camera/radar pairing, metadata, frame-rate selection, calibration journals, and playback loading |
| `test_manual_snapshot.py` | Snapshot folder validation, indexes, metadata, and cleanup after failure |
| `test_snapshot_playback.py` | Paired-entry filtering, stepping, rendering controls, and copy-current-pair behavior |
| `test_camera_pipeline_policy.py` | Decoder choice, pipeline structure, PTS/NTP timestamping, and capture callbacks |

## What the suite does not prove

The tests primarily use temporary folders, fake point clouds, synthetic CAN
payloads, fake GStreamer samples, mocked clocks, and fake GUI/process objects.
Passing tests do not establish:

- access to the real radar gateway or DVR;
- correct physical A/B/C channel placement;
- actual GStreamer plugin or hardware-decoder availability;
- the negotiated RTSP transport or real packet loss;
- sustained 30 FPS capture and JPEG writing;
- fullscreen calibration appearance or barcode readability through the camera;
- the correctness of the operational camera-delay value for a new session;
- clean interaction among the real FreeSimpleGUI, OpenCV, GTK, and Pygame
  windows.

Those behaviors require separate checks on the target installation. UI checks
should be completed by the project owner or from screenshots they deliberately
provide.
